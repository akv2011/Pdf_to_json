Markets corrected during the early part of May 2025 due \nto escalating tensions between India and Pakistan, following India’s launch of ‘Operation Sindoor’ targeting terrorist infrastructure in \nPakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir. However, sentiment improved thereafter as tensions eased.\nThe Nifty 50 and BSE Sensex indices posted monthly gains of 1.7% and 1.5%, respectively, in May 2025. However, the benchmark \nindices remain down by approximately 5-6% from their peak. Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) continued to remain net buyers for \nthe second consecutive month with a net inflow of US$2.3 billion. Meanwhile, Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) bought US$7.9 \nbillion during the month.\nThe broader market indices' performance was comparatively much better, with BSE MidCap and BSE SmallCap reporting monthly \ngains of 5.3% and 10.6%, respectively. Among the sector indices, Defence, Industrials, Real Estate and Metals outperformed with \nmonth gains of 21.8%, 14.3%, 7.2% and 5.9%, respectively. However, Utilities and FMCG underperformed with monthly losses of \n0.9% and 0.7%, respectively. \nIndia’s real GDP growth accelerated to 7.4% YoY in Q4FY25 from 6.4% in the previous quarter. In Q4FY25, the agriculture sector \nrecorded healthy growth of 5.4%, supported by strong agricultural output. The manufacturing sector’s growth further recovered \nto 4.8% YoY from 3.6% YoY in the previous quarter. Services sector growth remained resilient as weakness in the Trade+ segment \nwas more than offset by strong construction activity and improvement in the Financial Services+ segment. Private consumption \ngrowth slowed to 6.0% YoY in Q4FY25 from 8.1% in the previous quarter, as indicators point to subdued urban consumption. Fixed \ninvestment growth rebounded to 9.4% YoY in Q4 from 5.2% in Q3 as government capital expenditure picked up.\nFor FY25, real GDP growth eased to 6.5% YoY from 9.2% in the previous year. Nominal GDP growth declined to 9.8% YoY in FY25 \nfrom 12% YoY in FY24, as weaker real GDP growth outweighed the impact of a higher GDP deflator (inflation). On the production \nside, the manufacturing sector witnessed the steepest decline in its contribution to GDP growth in FY25, while on the expenditure \nside, fixed investment experienced the sharpest drop in contribution, followed by government consumption. \nIndia’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation eased to 3.16% YoY in April 2025 from 3.34% in the previous month. The decline in \nheadline inflation was driven by a fall in food inflation to 2.1% YoY in April 2025 from 2.9% YoY in March 2025. Core inflation (which \nexcludes food and fuel) remained flat at 4.2% YoY. \nThe IMD has updated the forecast for the Southwest Monsoon to 106% of the long-period average, up from the previous 105%. The \nIMD assigned a 59% likelihood to an above-normal or excess monsoon, a 31% chance of a normal monsoon, and only a 10% chance \nof it being below normal or deficient. \nOutlook\nThe reciprocal tariffs announced on 2nd April pose a significant threat to global growth. These measures are likely to drive inflation \nin the United States and disrupt global trade flows. While India is relatively better positioned than many other countries, which may \nface steeper tariffs, its exports to the US are still expected to come under pressure due to a slowdown in the US economy. However, \nmerchandise exports to the US amount to only 2% of GDP, which limits the impact of tariffs. With significant uncertainty surrounding \nthe implementation of tariffs and their potential impact on global trade, the equity risk premium has the potential to rise across \nmarkets. Hence, investors should prepare for further volatility.\nThe domestic macro environment is turning conducive to an economic recovery. First, income tax reductions will increase consumers' \ndisposable income, benefiting consumption-driven sectors, particularly discretionary consumption. Second, food inflation is expected \nto remain benign due to robust agricultural production, which will further support consumption. Third, more interest rate cuts are \nexpected in 2025 to stimulate the economy. Fourth, regulatory easing is also underway, with the RBI reversing the November 2023 \nhike in risk weights for bank loans to NBFCs and microfinance consumer credit loans. \nLooking ahead, we expect key shifts in market trends:\n• Growth leadership is shifting from government capital expenditures to consumer discretionary spending.\n• After an outperformance of around three years, Value may take a back seat, and Quality and growth factors may regain favour.  \n   Looking ahead, discretionary consumption is expected to rise, driven by budget stimulus for the urban middle class, followed by a  \n  pay commission-related boost next year. Additionally, liquidity easing, accompanied by rate cuts, would create a favourable  \n   premise for growth and quality to come back. \n• In our portfolios, we have been shifting some weight from Value to quality and growth over the last year.\nSeveral high-growth areas have strong value-creation potential. Key segments include auto EV plays, manufacturing, and pharma \nCDMO. The power transmission, distribution, and renewable energy sectors also present significant opportunities. Quick commerce \nis an emerging sector expected to experience exponential growth over the next five years. Additionally, telecom and high-quality \nprivate banks remain attractive value segments.\nWe have consistently maintained a more favourable stance towards inward-looking sectors driven by domestic fundamentals, rather \nthan those reliant on external or global factors. Our outlook continues to reflect this preference, as we believe domestic-oriented \nsectors offer greater resilience and stability amid global uncertainties.\nSource: CMIE, Bloomberg and Internal research",

The \ndecline in headline inflation was driven by a fall in food inflation to 2.1% YoY in April 2025 from 2.9% YoY in March \n2025. Within food, a lower contribution from vegetables drove the decline in headline inflation. Vegetable inflation \neased to -11.0% YoY in April 2025 from -7.0% YoY in March, on account of a 3.0% MoM correction in vegetable prices. \nCore inflation (which excludes food and fuel) remained flat at 4.2% YoY. Underlying inflation pressures remained \nsubdued, as indicated by a refined measure of core inflation (which additionally excludes transportation fuel and \nvaluables), measuring 3.5% YoY in April 2025. The inflation outlook remains benign and especially in the next 6 \nmonths headline CPI will benefit from a big base effect as well.\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced an all-time high dividend transfer of Rs 2.69 trillion to the Government \nof India. Furthermore, the revised range for the Contingency Risk Buffer (CRB) has been decided at 6.0 ± 1.5% of the \nbalance sheet size (as against the existing level of 6.5%- 5.5%) – as part of the periodic review of the Economic Capital \nFramework. The CRB has been raised to 7.5%.\nThe IMD has updated the forecast for the Southwest Monsoon to 106% (+/- 4%) of the long-period average (LPA), up \nfrom the previous 105% (+/- 5%). During June to September 2025, normal to above normal rainfall is very likely over \nmost parts of the country, except some areas of Northwest and East India and many areas of Northeast India, where \nbelow normal rainfall is very likely.  The average rainfall for the country as a whole during June 2025 is most likely \nto be above normal (>108% of LPA).\nIn FY25, direct tax collection rose by 13% YoY to Rs. 21.7 tn, up from Rs. 19.2 tn in FY24 but fell short of the revised \ntarget of Rs. 22.4 tn by Rs. 673 bn, primarily due to a Rs. 740 bn shortfall in personal income tax. Disinvestment \nproceeds remained weak at Rs. 172 bn, well below the Rs. 330 bn target. Revenue expenditure increased by 3.1% \nYoY to Rs. 36 tn, lower than the revised estimate of Rs. 37 tn, while capital expenditure exceeded the target by Rs. \n336 bn to reach Rs. 10.5 tn. The fiscal deficit target of 4.8% of GDP was met as budgeted.\nGlobal:\nMoody’s Ratings downgraded the United States’ last remaining top-tier credit rating, citing growing concerns over \nthe country’s rising debt and persistent budget deficits. The agency cut the US rating from AAA to Aa1, aligning with \nearlier downgrades by Fitch and S&P Global, and marking the first time all three major agencies have rated the US \nbelow AAA.  During the mid-month, US and China agreed to a 90-day tariff truce, with deeper-than-expected tariff \ncuts. Meanwhile, the uncertainty around the tariffs continued as the US federal court blocked the US President from \nimposing sweeping tariffs on imports under an emergency powers law. However, the US appeals court reinstated the \nUS President's tariffs a day after they were deemed illegal.\nPresident Donald Trump announced that the US will double its current tariff rate on steel and aluminium imports from \n25% to 50%, effective June 4, 2025. Trump also accused China of violating the Geneva deal. The US 10Y yield has \nsurged by around 40bps in May to 4.6% (as of 21 May) amidst fiscal worries as US fiscal concerns are in focus with \ntax bill under consideration that could increase the US deficit by USD 3.8 trillion over the next decade, according to \nthe Congressional Budget Office. \n10 Year Benchmark Bond Movement\nSpread Movement\nSpreads\nMaturity Period\nAAA\nAA\nA\n30-May-25\n1 Yr\n103\n175\n314\n3 Yr\n98\n167\n300\n5 Yr\n91\n164\n292\n10 Yr\n74\n150\n290\n30-Apr-25\n1 Yr\n99\n172\n314\n3 Yr\n92\n162\n301\n5 Yr\n87\n162\n294\n10 Yr\n73\n145\n300",

RBI continues to \nmake largescale purchase of government securities from the secondary market as part of its operations to infuse \nliquidity into the banking system. Indian Fixed income markets remained supported in the month of May despite \nadverse global cues. The US yields climbed higher due to fiscal worries and firmer-than-expected economic activity \ndata deferring interest rate cut expectations by the Fed. The UST 10Y yield has risen ~24 bps mom, closing the month \nof May at 4.40% (reaching highs of 4.63% during the month). Domestically, bond markets have rallied, barring the \nIndo-Pak border escalation episode. Favourable CPI inflation trends and record dividend announcement by the RBI \nsupported the bond markets, though higher than expected GDP growth print at the end of the last week weighed on \nthe bond market sentiments. The new benchmark 10Y G-sec is trading ~11 bps lower at around 6.21% since its issue. \nFPIs also continued inflows worth ~10k crores after profit booking in April. \nAverage banking system liquidity surplus stood at Rs 1.7 lakh crore till mid-month and improved to ~2.2 lakh crore till \nthe close of the month. RBI infused liquidity in the markets through Open Market Operations (OMOs) of Rs. 1.25 lakh \ncrore exceeding market estimates on OMOs pushing the yield curve lower. We expect durable liquidity in the ~Rs5-6 \ntrillion range over the next few months, with the flow of funds to the banking system expected to come with a lag as \ngovernment spending picks up pace. we expect cash balances to moderate to around Rs2.7 trillion driven by debt \nbuyback and continued government spending. Money market rates eased by 30bps across the 3-month to 1-year \ntenure favouring corporates and NBFC borrowers with risk premium narrowing with large infuse of liquidity. We think \nmarket has already priced in two rate cuts both in bonds and OIS markets, also spreads compressed between the \nG-sec and corporate bonds as investors subscribed for better accrual specially in the short-medium term yield curve \ni.e. 2–5-year maturity. The narrowing spread between the US treasury and India’s G-secs (at 165 bps it has narrowed \nby roughly three-quarters) may act as a deterrent for the yields to soften further significantly further add complexity \nof Japan rising yield and inflation. It is important to disentangle whether the narrowing gap is primarily due to India’s \nimproving macroeconomic fundamentals or external developments like US monetary policy shifts. In truth, it is a \ncombination of both. \nOutlook:\nSoftening global commodity prices, above- normal rainfall expectations and probable improvement in agricultural \noutput helping headline inflation remain benign. Combined with expectations of decline in the U.S. dollar index and \nanticipated rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve create further room for monetary easing in India leading to further \ndecline in domestic yields in the coming months. We expect the Indian benchmark 10-year bond yield to trade in the \n6.10-6.30% range taking into consideration scope for a deeper rate cut cycle and continued easy liquidity.\nSource: CMIE, Bloomberg and Internal research",

Accordingly, the debt schemes of the Mutual Fund shall be placed in PRC matrix as \nfollows:\nPOTENTIAL RISK CLASS OF A SCHEME\nGLOSSARY OF TERMS\nCredit Risk of scheme → \nRelatively Low\n(Class A)\nModerate\n(Class B)\nRelatively High\n (Class C)\nInterest Rate Risk of the Scheme\nRelatively Low (Class I)\nA-I\nNIL\nB-I\n360 ONE Liquid Fund\nC-I\nNIL\nModerate (Class II)\nA - II\nNIL\nB - II\nNIL\nC-I\nNIL\nRelatively High (Class III)\nA - III\nNIL\nB - III\nNIL\nC - III\n360 ONE Dynamic Bond Fund\nFUND MANAGER\nAn employee of the asset management company such as a mutual fund or life insurer, who manages investments of the scheme. He is usually part of a \nlarger team of fund managers and research analysts.\nAPPLICATION AMOUNT FOR FRESH SUBSCRIPTION\nThis is the minimum investment amount for a new investor in a mutual fund scheme.\nMINIMUM ADDITIONAL AMOUNT\nThis is the minimum investment amount for an existing investor in a mutual fund scheme.\nYIELD TO MATURITY\nThe Yield to Maturity or the YTM is the rate of return anticipated on a bond if held until maturity. YTM is expressed as an annual rate. The YTM factors in \nthe bond's current market price, par value, coupon interest rate and time to maturity.\nSIP\nSIP or systematic investment plan works on the principle of making periodic investments of a fixed sum. It works similar to a recurring bank deposit. For \ninstance, an investor may opt for an SIP that invests ` 500 every 15th of the month in an equity fund for a period of three years.\nNAV\nThe NAV or the net asset value is the total asset value per unit of the mutual fund after deducting all related and permissible expenses. The NAV is \ncalculated at the end of every business day. It is the value at which the investor enters or exits the mutual fund.\nBENCHMARK\nA group of securities, usually a market index, whose performance is used as a standard or benchmark to measure investment performance of mutual \nfunds, among other investments. Some typical benchmarks include the Nifty, Sensex, BSE200, BSE500, 10-Year Gsec.\nENTRY LOAD\nA mutual fund may have a sales charge or load at the time of entry and/or exit to compensate the distributor/agent. Entry load is charged at the time an \ninvestor purchases the units of a mutual fund. The entry load is added to the prevailing NAV at the time of investment. For instance, if the NAV is ` 100 \nand the entry load is 1 %, the investor will enter the fund at ` 101.\nEXIT LOAD\nExit load is charged at the time an investor redeems the units of a mutual fund. The exit load is deducted from the prevailing NAV at the time of \nredemption. For instance, if the NAV is ` 100 and the exit load is 1%, the redemption price would be `99 per unit.\nMODIFIED DURATION\nModified duration is the price sensitivity and the percentage change in price for a unit change in yield.\nSTANDARD DEVIATION\nStandard deviation is a statistical measure of the range of an investment's performance. When a mutual fund has a high standard deviation, its means its \nrange of performance is wide, implying greater volatility.\nSHARPE RATIO\nThe Sharpe Ratio, named after its founder, the Nobel Laureate William Sharpe, is a measure of risk-adjusted returns. It is calculated using\nstandard deviation and excess return to determine reward per unit of risk.\nBETA\nBeta is a measure of an investment's volatility vis-a-vis the market. Beta of less than 1 means that the security will be less volatile than the market. A beta \nof greater than 1 implies that the security's price will be more volatile than the market.\nR-SQUARED\nR-squared measures the relationship between a portfolio and its benchmark index. It measures the correlation of the portfolio's returns to the\nbenchmark's returns.\nTREYNOR RATIO\nDeveloped by Jack Treynor, the Treynor ratio (also known as the \"reward-to-volatility ratio\") attempts to measure how well an investment has \ncompensated its investors given its level of risk. The Treynor ratio relies on beta, which measures an investment's sensitivity to market \nmovements, to gauge risk.\nAUM\nAUM or assets under management refers to the recent I updated cumulative market value of investments managed by a mutual fund or any investment \nfirm.\nTRACKING ERROR\nMeans the annualized standard deviation of the difference in daily returns between the underlying index and the NAV of the Scheme.\nTRACKING DIFFERENCE\nMeans the annualized difference of daily returns between the index and the NAV of the Scheme.\nHOLDINGS\nThe holdings or the portfolio is a mutual fund's latest or updated reported statement of investments/securities. These are usually displayed in terms \nof percentage to net assets or the rupee value or both. The objective is to give investors an idea of where their money is being invested by the fund \nmanager.\nNATURE OF SCHEME\nThe investment objective and underlying investments determine the nature of the mutual fund scheme. For instance, a mutual fund that aims at generat-\ning capital appreciation by investing in stock markets is an equity fund or growth fund. Likewise, a mutual fund that aims at capital preservation by \ninvesting in debt markets is a debt fund or income fund. Each of these categories may have sub-categories.\nRATING PROFILE\nMutual funds invest in securities after evaluating their creditworthiness as disclosed by the ratings. A depiction of the mutual fund in various investments \nbased on their ratings becomes the rating profile of the fund. Typically, this is a feature of debt funds.\nIDCW\nDividend option is renamed as Income Distribution cum Capital Withdrawal (IDCW) option for all Schemes effective from April 1, 2021\n→",
